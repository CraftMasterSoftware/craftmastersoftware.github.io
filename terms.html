<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

The Terms will be governed by California law as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction, and applicable federal law. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in Santa Clara County, California or federal court for the Northern District of California. Headings are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting these Terms.
